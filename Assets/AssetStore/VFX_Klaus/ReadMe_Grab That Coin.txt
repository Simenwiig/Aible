////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Thank you for purchasing the Grab That Coin Package.
All the effect prepab is made of only two materials(for Coins and for Particle Effects).
A PNG file with a detailed description is located in the path below.

    [VFX_Klaus -> Prefabs -> Grab That Coin]
        "Grab That Coin_How Does It Work (Coin)"
        "Grab That Coin_How Does It Work (Particle)"
        "Grab That Coin_How To Change Coin Set"

Material and shader named "VFX_lab" is not used for effects.
It was used in the background of Scene just to show the effect.

Thank you once again, and I hope my effect will be useful for your development.
